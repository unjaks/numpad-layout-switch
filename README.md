this was originally made for personal use with gta 5 mods

# numpad-layout-switch
# ⚠ WINDOWS ONLY ⚠
## make it yourself
- compile numpadEmu.cpp with whatever you use ("gcc" for example)
- run the generated .exe as admin 
- **caps lock ON** → numpad mode  
- **caps lock OFF** → normal mode
### OR
- download the precompiled .exe from releases if you "don't care tbh"

## notes
- keep it running in the background
- works only for numbers
- should only be used if your keyboard doesn't have a numpad (duh)

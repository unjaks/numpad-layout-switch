this was originally made for personal use with gta 5 mods

# numpad-layout
## quick(?) setup
- compile it (windows only)
- run the .exe (might need admin)  
- **caps lock ON** → numpad mode  
- **caps lock OFF** → normal mode
### OR
- download the .exe from releases if you don't care about your own safety (i TOTALLY put like 10 viruses in there)

## notes
- keep it running in the background
- works for 0-9
